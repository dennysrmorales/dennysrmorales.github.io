	<div id="description"><img id="aboutMePic" src="images/picture1.jpg" alt="Avatar"> <p>My name is Dennys Morales and I am currenlty seeking full time opportunities in the Software Engineering, Web Development, Data Engineering, or Data Analysis fields. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineeirng in 2016. Six months into my Mechanical Engineering job, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I left my Mechanical Engineering job and completed a Software Engineering Internship at Second Spectrum. There I was part of the Data Team. I helped our team build automated data processing systems for a video query product for professional soccer teams. For a more detailed description of my technical expreiences please see my <a <a href="Dennys-Morales-Resume.pdf">resume.</a> </p>
	<p>Besides loving to learn new technologies, I enjoy traveling, sports, and the outdoors. I love being immersed in different cultures and learning all about other countries. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am working on my Italian and French. Being a native Californian has influenced my love for the outdoors. I am a huge fan of backpacking, hiking, beaches, trail runs, kayaking, and more. Whenever I am not working, there is a good chance that I will either be playing or watching sports. An example of  the ideal scenario where I could mix all of these hobbies would be one where I could  play soccer in a pitch full of fresh crisp, green grass with a view of the Andes mountains in Chile.</p> </div>
