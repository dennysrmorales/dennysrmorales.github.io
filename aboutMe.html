	<div id="description"><img id="aboutMePic" src="images/picture1.jpg" alt="Avatar"> <p>My name is Dennys Morales, and I am a Software Engineer at Lytx. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2016. Six months into my Mechanical Engineering experience, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I left my Mechanical Engineering job to complete an internship in Software Engineering at Second Spectrum, a sports analytics-based company. There, I was part of the Data Team, and built automated data processing systems for a video query product aimed to improve professional soccer teams' performances. For a more detailed description of my technical experiences please see my <a href="Dennys-Morales-Resume.pdf">resume.</a> </p>
	<p>Aside from learning new technologies, I really enjoy traveling, sports, tutoring, and being outdoors. For a couple hours every week, I tutor middle and high school students with a goal of helping them reach their maximum academic potential. I love getting immersed in different cultures and learning all about other countries. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am working on Italian and French. Being a native Californian has influenced my love for the outdoors. I am a huge fan of backpacking, hiking, beaches, trail runs, kayaking, and more. Whenever I am not working, there is a good chance that I will either be playing or watching sports. One of my fondest memories is of when I was able to mix all of these passions, playing soccer in a pitch full of fresh green grass with a view of the majestic Andes mountains while I studied abroad in Chile! </p> </div>
